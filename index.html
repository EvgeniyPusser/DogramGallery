            chronicles the development of a visual art form created using film technologies that began in the
            late 19th century.
        
            The advent of film as an artistic medium is not clearly defined. There were earlier cinematographic screenings by
            others
            like the first showing of life sized pictures in motion 1894 in Berlin by Ottomar Anschütz; however, the commercial,
            public screening of ten Lumière brothers' short films in Paris on 28 December 1895, can be regarded as the
            breakthrough
            of projected cinematographic motion pictures. The earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long,
            without
            recorded sound, and consisted of a single shot from a steady camera. The first decade saw film move from a novelty,
            to
            an established mass entertainment industry, with film production companies and studios established throughout the
            world.
            Conventions toward a general cinematic language developed, with film editing, camera movements and other cinematic
            techniques contributing specific roles in the narrative of films.
        
            The first feature-length film is generally considered to be the Australian film The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906).
        
            Various film genres have emerged during the history of film, and enjoyed variable degrees of success.</span>
